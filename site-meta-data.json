    "description": "I'm a Stanford undergraduate and masters' computer science student, with experience in industry software engineering and artificial intelligence research. I'm currently a researcher at the Stanford IRIS (Intelligence through Robotic Interactions at Scale) Lab, where I try to teach robots to do tasks correctly. In my free time, I like to mess around with music, write puzzles, and make games. Check out some of my work with the links above!"
